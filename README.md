Value your time

These are the steps to save your time:

1. Search for manga in the main window
  
2. Check the manga you want to add and set up it
2.1. Put your preffered url to open or don't
2.2. Enter on what chapter you are now
2.3. Choose group which translates to get notifications only when they got chapter on their site(like if you use https://www.asurascans.com/, then you choose Asura group)
2.3.1.If you're not sure about the group click Check, go to groups translating and find your one, and check the group's site
2.3.2. If you have some groups but you don't have your grooup my recomendation is to change the group you're reading
OR
2.3.3. If you don't have any group, then you can check a box to save it in default list(It means that you can open these manga only in the reading list(open new chapters) by clicking "open default". You can't change this list in your list)
2.4. Click Done(if closed it doesn't saves the settings. You can change them in the "your list")
   
3. When all manga is added you can check for new chapters(yeah it will take a while, but it's worth it)

IMPORTANT!
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ~45 MANGA TO CHECK THE APP WILL NOT RESPONSE BUT DON'T CLOSE IT, BECAUSE IT WORKS AND YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT 1 MINUTE TO CHECK OTHER 45 MANGA,
SO THAT YOU DON'T GET 429 ERROR(TOO MANY REQUESTS)
But I think you still able to get 429 error it will go away with some time(with time I'll made a window if you hit 429 error)
So if you have 200 manga you need to wait around 4-5 mins, I know that sucks but it's better than checking every manga by yourself.

4. Click "open new chapters"
4.1. Check manga you want to read(you can press "check all") and click "Open in browser". It will open it in last window of browser you used(i think so?)
4.2. Read manga
4.3. After you've read manga check every manga you've read and click "Read"
4.3.1. If manga checked and chapter is left, It will change your last chapter you've read to the last new chapter

5. You saved your time!
